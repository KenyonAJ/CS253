CS253:  Data Structures and Algorithms

Collection of my solutions to assignments from this semester.  Using/used 
R. Lafore's DS & A 2nd ed. as a supplementary text, and in the cases where
I found his choice of variable names especially helpful to code readibility I 
didn't see any point in changing them.
